hockeyapp-log-exporter
======================

A console app to export hockeyapp logs to a CSV format. The application is still in development, but usage will eventually 
work as such:

    $> HockeyAppDownload 5 > output.csv
    
You will be able to specify the number of days of logs that you want to download, and then pipe it into an output file.
